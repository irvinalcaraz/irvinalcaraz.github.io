 model that can be built to predict whether or I'll like a game. I'd love for this to be fully blown out by something like what you see on last.fm or even on Spotify's curated playlists. 

What drives the popularity of a game and is there any way to model that?

I think that the type, category, and mechanism are going to really important to predicting what games I like

-> the main reason for this is because I HATE Cards against humanity which has a type & category of "party" and the mechniasm of "player judge". Those games realy to heavily on previously established human connections which makes them extremely impartial.
