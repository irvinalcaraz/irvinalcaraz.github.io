Overarching field to learn is data science. Specifically I want to understand the entire process or going from data to implementing a model.

* The main way that this will be learned is through projects.
* In addition to projects I will build time in for books and courses however they are supplementary as I expect most learning will be done through the trial and error and research done within a project.


Project: Learn to implement a learning chatbot in python that recognizes audio and eventually recognizes face


-> two big domains here
- Python chat bot implementations
- AI modeling for Audio 
	- I should be able to find a model prebuilt to understand speech
	- I can also find one to recognize images
	- Eventually I would like to implement my own model. This is where the learning will come into play.




Principles
1 - Metalearning
2 - Focus
3 - Directness
4 - Drill
5 - Retrieval
6 - Feedback
7 - Retention

Resources:


Sample Cirriculumn:
Python/R
Stats/Linear Algebra
Numpy/Pandas/Matplotlib
ML Algorithms
Production Systems

I took about a month to review the Python docs, the Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to Python, and coding challenges on CodeSignal.
Check out the Pandas Docs, Numpy Docs, and Matplotlib Tutorials. There are better resources out there, but these are what I used.
