The days of impulsively purchasing any and every boardgame that seems appealing are coming to an end for me. I'm being a little dramatic here for the purpose of this post because it's not like I was purchasing games simply based on the box and without any context. My purchasing journey is quite a contrast to that and typical of what I see others go through for most other big purchases. You have a phase where you find out about the game. Then you start looking it up maybe wayching a playthrough or two to see how the game works. Finally you decide that you might want the game for yourself but before you add the game to your cart you decide you want to consult reviews. This is when the knowledge of BoardGameGeek is invoked to see what others think of the game. After all, you don't want to be stuck with a game that's an absolute bore to play yourself or worse, one that is absolutely broken because of some poorly thought out mechanic. 

The majority of the time I end up loving the game that I purchase and on occasion there are the cases where the game ends up dissapointing me. It's hard to pinpoint why certain games don't agree with me but if there was a way to circumvent this issue I certainly would put my support behind it. It's for this reason that I'm interested in seeing if there's a model that can be built to predict whether or I'll like a game. I'd love for this to be fully blown out by something like what you see on last.fm or even on Spotify's curated playlists. 

In thinking about modelling this I'm also left with the curiosity of another question. What drives the popularity of a game and is there any way to model that? Certainly both of these questions are intertwined and perhaps the latter will develop a metric by which we can predict the former.
