title: Photos from San Francisco
---

I took a trip to San Francisco under the pretense of a friend hosting a park party all the way back around the end of July in 2025. I took tons of photos during that trip but at this point in the year I was no longer feeling the fire from photography that I was before. The same friend asked me where the photos from that trip were and that was enough to get me onto my computer to finally fix up some of the photos.

We started the trip by parking in one of the paid DIA lots for once. We're usually the types to take a rideshare to the airport and return on the train or another rideshare but with this being a short weekend trip it ended up costing around the same to just park in the lots. It made it super convenient getting home and picking up the dogs from our friends over in Louisville. I love this picture because of how creamy the clouds ended up looking. I must have boosted the exposure a bit because it's nice and bright too.
