title: Photos from San Francisco
---

I took a trip to San Francisco under the pretense of a friend hosting a park party all the way back around the end of July in 2025. I took tons of photos during that trip but at this point in the year I was no longer feeling the fire from photography that I was before. The same friend asked me where the photos from that trip were and that was enough to get me onto my computer to finally fix up some of the photos.

We started the trip by parking in one of the paid DIA lots for once. We're usually the types to take a rideshare to the airport and return on the train or another rideshare but with this being a short weekend trip it ended up costing around the same to just park in the lots. It made it super convenient getting home and picking up the dogs from our friends over in Louisville. I love this picture because of how creamy the clouds ended up looking. I must have boosted the exposure a bit because it's nice and bright too. Here's a little secret. This photo is actually from the end of our trip, but I didn't think to capture one as we were leaving.

Since we were staying with my friend Nicole we flew into SJC instead of SFO. The airport is pretty small but the experience getting through it is incredibly smooth. It's full name was given from a former mayor of the city Norman Mineta. I don't recall exactly anymore but I think we made a quick stop at her place before heading out to spends some time in San Jose. The city is quite nice and has the character of a full city, but doesn't feel like it has any historic charm. Perhaps it's just the part I was in but it all felt pretty commercial. That's not to say there aren't gorgeous buildings like the one above that caught my eye. Such a cool combination of blues partially just from the windows and a kind of patchwork feeling. I really love views of architecture even if they seem kind of basic. Huge buildings are just so impressive and imposing that it's hard not to be transfixed.

We ended up walking through a small strip off San Pedro street that contained a ton of food options. We were ultimately planning on going to the tiki bar in this area at some point and we walked around while deciding what to eat. Mexican ended up winning out as the crowd favorite and the spot we had ate at had pretty decent grub. We sat by a cute window and ordered a couple margaritas as we caught up. After some delicious food we had some subpar ice cream at a nearby shop and finally headed out to the tiki bar. We went to Dr. Funk's and it was really sweet inside. The drinks were decent but more than anything it was fun to be around friend you love and get to do something you've done in so many cities. We were going to go to a bar-cade after this but somehow I forgot my ID. I'm not sure how we got so many drinks at other places but I felt pretty dumb for once again forgetting to carry my ID to a bar. I feel so encumbered by a wallet that I'll leave it behind any chance I can get.

Heading home I got to catch up with Lydia. She was less shy that previous times. I'm guessing Milly being over and the two of us being relatively quiet made her comfortable enough to venture out. I thought she might pop the air mattress overnight but no such thing happened. I just know if Lentil and Buffy were here they'd be all over that thing.

The next day we got up bright and early and had some Paris Baguette. It was alright. I've had their goods before in other parts of the state so I wasn't too enthused. We then made the trek over to visit some of the museums of the city. Despite having been here so many times I still hadn't seen so many of the museums. I never had time when I went with college friends and as an
